# Load-Forecasting
Demand Forecasting with Scikit-Learn's Algorithms and Arima Model
Files Forecasting_"Algorithms" allow to make short-term Load Forecasting in a horizon of two weeks.
The data file NIS_MW_06-2020 corresponds to the Ecuadorian Power Demand in June 2020.
The .xlsx file "Comparison" allows to compare the Demand Forecasting Results with the last two weeks of real demand.
The pdf file shows a presentation of hyperparameter tuning for scikit-learn's algorithms and the adjustement of parameters p,d,q for ARIMA model
